# CST-301-AST-Part2
Reads an abstract syntax tree, and retrieves the documentation of any found classes and functions.

## Build and Execute
This project was made with the use of Gradle. After cloning this repository, simply navigate to the root directory of the project in the Linux shell, and run the following command:

	./gradlew run

On Windows, the following command should be used instead:
 
	gradlew.bat

## Sample program/tree

The sample tree file was generated by parsing `src/main/antlr/assets/Sample.java` using the ANTLR4 library. This tree file is located in the same folder as its respective java file.

## Output

On execution, the sample AST will be printed to the console, as well as a list of every node in the tree (including children/parent data, types, and identifier). Afterwards, every class and function reference detected within the tree will be listed in console, alongside a description of the class/function in question if it is listed within the official Java documentation.
